Disclaimer: "Project Seasons" is not my mod this is just a small update to a great mod, if the mod owner reached out to me to take it down, I have no choice but to delete it from the public

The version of Project Zomboid must be Build 42, this was updated when game version was:42.12.3.
The mod Project Seasons may be updated in the future and making this fix obsolete, but until then it's a personal patch of mine.

Installation
1. Download the original "Project Seasons" mod from: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412105017&searchtext=Project+seasons
2. Download the folder itself and put it at the directory: C:\Users\(Your Username)\Zomboid\mods
3. Open Project Zomboid and enable the mod. In turn it will also enable "Project Seasons"
4. Make sure that the "Project Seasons" is loaded first, and then my small update fix.
5. Profit.
