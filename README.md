### ⚠️ Disclaimer

"Project Seasons" is **not** my original creation; this is simply a small community update. If the original mod owner reaches out and requests this patch be taken down, I will immediately comply and remove it from public distribution.

### ⚙️ Compatibility & Version

* **Required Game Version:** Project Zomboid Build 42 (Specifically tested and updated when the game version was **42.12.3**).
* **Note:** The official "Project Seasons" mod may update in the future, potentially making this patch obsolete. This version is offered until such an official update occurs.
